# In memory of Jon


Dear all, 

In this time of covid, we can not meet in person and gather to start/continue our grieving process. I would really love if we could organise something online. I would imagine a 30 min video call with one statement, and/or a video of Jon, some music and an activity (we could all light a candle for instance), something to be together and say farewell.

I propose to get a get-together event on Thursday 16th at 17h CET (15h UCT) using jitsi video conference.

Please add ideas using issues, and add documents  (video, images, music, texts) you think would fit.
